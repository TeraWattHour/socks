# Socks

Socks is a simple template engine for Go. It is made to be simple
and easy to use. It's not a code generator, so its performance is
not the best, but it's good enough for most use cases.

## Roadmap
- [x] Global functions
- [x] For loops
- [x] Method/variable chaining
- [x] Simple inheritance
- [x] Template embedding
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] Local variable initialization
- [ ] Inline math/boolean operations (currently only external function calls are supported)
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Better formatting with preprocessor?
