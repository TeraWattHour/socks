# Socks

Socks is a simple template engine for Go. It is made to be simple
and easy to use. It's not a code generator, so its performance is
not the best, but it's good enough for most use cases.

## Roadmap
- [x] Global functions
- [x] For loops
- [x] Template inheritance
- [x] Template embedding
- [x] If statements
- [x] Inline math/boolean operations
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Write proper tests
